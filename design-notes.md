  - Basics
    - Start UI in Angular
    - Server with database, tracking users who have many feelposts
    - Front page with a friendly, variable prompt, asking user to express their mental state on a spectrum of emoji
    - Variable prompt after selection of emoji, friendlily inviting user to record some thoughts about the emotion they picked
    - At least one visualization of this data after collection
  - Stretch
    - Machine learning for different tones in extension prompts
    - Mobile reminders?
    - Sentiment analysis
    - Reflection reminders from past
    - Refactor to React
- Stack
  - Angular vs. React vs. Backbone
    - Backbone
      - Pros: familiarity, simplicity
      - Cons: don’t want to use it, bad, unproductive
    - Angular
      - Pros: fast, easy, looks nice, might be on test, works with D3
      - Cons: doesn’t scale well, can be confusing, 
    - React
      - Pros: more intuitive organization and structure
      - Cons: have to learn it
  - D3
  - Node, Express, Passport
  - Sequelize vs. native driver
  - Postgres vs. MySQL vs. Firebase
  - Gulp
- Design Principles
  - Two halves: 
    - user interaction, input, health, etc.
    - [COMPLETE] visualization of data, life expectancy, risk, etc.
- Brainstorm Notes
  - How habits affect life expectancy
  - Dark, funny
  - Perspective on habits
  - “Positive” messages from one area of screen (popup bubbles?), “negative” messages from another area of screen
    - Use conversational metaphor for reflecting on choices and keeping a log of thoughts, decisions etc.
  - Statistics on risks visualized through the days of the calendar
  - Asks what you had for lunch, what you did over the weekend, etc.
    - Time context, place context
    - API for data collection? Fitbit?
  - NOT social -- highly personal
